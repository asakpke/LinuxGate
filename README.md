## ⚠️ Project Status - FUNCTIONAL BUT UNSTABLE
**WARNING: This project is functional but NOT RECOMMENDED for production use.**

The software is now working and can successfully set up a dual-boot environment. However, please be aware of the following limitations:

- ⚠️ **BIOS mode only** – UEFI mode has not been tested yet and may not work correctly
- ⚠️ **Not production-ready** – Use at your own risk, preferably on test machines
- ⚠️ **Backup recommended** – Always backup your data before attempting any dual-boot installation

felix068 is actively working on UEFI support and stability improvements. Contributions and bug reports are welcome!

## Project History
This project was initially started by [MopigamesYT](https://github.com/MopigamesYT) but was abandoned and left incomplete (non-functional). 

LinuxGate is based on the [LinuxGate project](https://github.com/ekimiateam/linuxgate), which was developed by felix068 during a company internship. The LinuxGate project was also left unfinished and non-functional.

This version represents a complete rework by felix068 aimed at creating a stable, functional dual-boot installer.
